# Computer-Graphics
A project where I can learn and master OpenGL and Computer Graphics.
My University has Computer Graphics courses in which we learn a technic in create a graphic using C++ and OpenGL. This is a place where I put all of the assignments during my studies.

**Branch named _"Vulkan"_ is my experiment with Vulkan since that is more useful that a OpenGL now. It is not recommend to download this branch because it is broken now.**

## Expected Output
![Result image](/Computer_Graphics/Resources/readme/ScreenshotRayMarched.png)

## Prerequisite
- Visual Studio 2019 (Recommend)
- GLFW-64bit (Included)
- GLEW-64bit (Included)
- GLM (Included) 

## Installation
As of now, I am not working on a way to easily download the code as a package for example CMake, PreMake, etc.
So, if you want to download this project, please bare with me and download all of it. Sorry for any inconvenience but I am woking on it.

## Running the program
The executable is in the ***"Computer_Graphics\Build\Release-x64" Directory***.
Or build the program using Visual Studio 2019 by open the solution file.

## TODO
- [x] Create Scene for easier scene switching
- [ ] Ray-Tracing function
- [ ] Create Package for easier installing
- [ ] Implement Vulkan and replace all OpenGL
- [ ] Documentation for easier useage
- [ ] More user-friendly code
